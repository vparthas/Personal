                <h1>Why Delta Sigs?</h1>
                <h3>A Message From Our President</h3>
                <p>Dear New College Student:
                <p>The Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity is a group of men who strive to make themselves and those around
                    them better. To do this we focus on three main parts of all of our lives: the elevation of academic thought,
                    working together for the common good, and promoting friendship within and outside the organization as well
                    as across time through events with alumni. All of our resources are directed toward accomplishing these goals.</p>
                <p>There are many stereotypes that are associated with fraternities and the Greek system in general. However, as
                    is true with all stereotypes, many of these are gross generalizations or are simply false. One of these stereotypes
                    is hazing. While some Greek organizations haze, Delta Sigma Phi is absolutely committed to not hazing its members.
                    Further hazing does not propagate the environment of respect and mutual friendship that Delta Sigma Phi seeks to elevate.</p>
                <p>Another of these stereotypes is that all fraternity men only party and drink. While we do have social events within the
                    brotherhood and sororities on campus, we seek to promote a balanced lifestyle for all of our members. As a chapter we
                    pride ourselves in the countless hours of community service and our stellar average chapter GPA which is well above the
                    all mens undergraduate average of 3.03. We also participate in Intramural football, soccer, We believe that there is a
                    place for all activities in our lives, allowing the Brothers to get the most out of their college experience.</p>
                <p>But, I know that just by telling you about my organization, you may not fully believe me. We invite you to our house for
                    barbecues, tailgates and other social gatherings to meet the brothers and experience the life as a Delta Sigma Phi.</p>
                <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
                <p>Isaac Narayan</p>
                <p>President, Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity Alpha Alpha Chapter</p>

        <div id="FAQSection">
            <p><h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1></p>
            <br><b>How does joining a fraternity help me in college?</b>
            <br>This question is by far the most common and also the hardest to answer.
                The benefits of a fraternity are based upon what your son wants to put into it.
            <br><br><b>Will my academics be affected?</b>
            <br>Delta Sigma Phi is a wealth of academic knowledge. Whether it be access to a computer labs,
                academic files, and other brothers  who have already taken the classes, you will never be alone
                in his academic pursuits. No matter the major, you will have at least one other brother who shares his major and
                can offer advice and advising on classes, teachers, and studying tips. This past semester Delta Sigma Phi ranked above
                the all fraternity average with a house GPA of 3.14.
            <br><br><b>How will I become a part of the community?</b>
            <br>First of all, the University of Illinois has one of the biggest Greek system in the nation. With over 40 fraternities
                on campus, we are glad that you chose Delta Sigma Phi. A great aspect of joining a fraternity is the ability for you
                to get involved in something bigger than yourself. As a member of Delta Sigma Phi, you are required to complete service
                hours, get involved in philanthropy events, play intramural sports in the Fraternity league, and are strongly encouraged
                to get involved in clubs outside of the fraternity itself. Members of Delta Sigma Phi come from diverse backgrounds and
                have varying interests in both life and academics. Inside the fraternity various leadership roles help boost resumes and
                provide invaluable experience for you.
            <br><br><b>How is the Delta Sig brotherhood?</b>
            <br>One of the greatest things about being in a fraternity are the relationships you will form with the other brothers.
                Whether it hanging out and watching a football game on the big screen, going to Assembly Hall to cheer on the Illini
                basketball team, heading to the ARC or the outdoor athletic complex for a pickup game or even staying up until 3:00 AM
                to simply have a talk about the world, the relationships you form will most be the strongest ones you will form in your
                lifetime.
            <br><br><b>What do dues pay for?</b>
            <br>Upon joining a fraternity, you will be required to pay semester dues which allow us to function as an organization.
                The majority of the dues paid go to our national organization which provides us with a variety of conferences, seminars,
                and leadership programs. The remainder of our dues go towards community service, philanthropy events, athletic teams,
                maintaining our house, brotherhood events like our annual camping trip, and social events such as exchanges with
                sororities and a formal dance.
            <br><br><b>How big of a time commitment is there?</b>
            <br>One of the biggest concerns you probably have is the issue of time management. How are you supposed to balance getting
                good grades with being social and being involved in various campus activities? While academics take up the majority of
                our time on campus, the fraternity only takes up what you want it to. On an official level, we have a chapter meeting
                every week on Monday evenings right after dinner at 6:00. This allows plenty of time afterwards for studying and homework.
                Other than that, there is no required time to be spent at the house or at fraternity events, and the majority of brothers
                who donâ€™t live in house come over when they are free and not busy with school work.
            <br><br><b>If I have a big test, am I allowed to skip fraternity events?</b>
            <br>You are here at the University of Illinois as a student first, fraternity member second. We make sure that all of our
                pledges and brothers know that and are reprimanded if he doesn't meed standards on exec board.
            <br><br><b>Does living in house offer any type of structure? Are there people responsible for the house?</b>
            <br>We at Delta Sigma Phi have a great house mom, Christie Singer. Christie prepares our meals for us Monday
                through Friday at lunch, and is always just a phone call away in the case of an emergency. Other than simply preparing meals,
                Christie acts as our mom making sure we do our chores and focus on grades. Often times she will sit down with us at lunch and
                talk about what is going on in the world and any struggles or issues we may be experiencing.
            <br><br><b>What is the policy on hazing?</b>
            <br>We pride ourselves in NOT hazing our pledges.
            <br><br><b>What are the expenses?</b>
            <br>Refer to this page.
            <br><br><b>Have more questions?</b>
            <br>If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact satkinson@illinideltasigs.org.
